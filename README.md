This folder holds all the tasks for the monty project.

The Monty language is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Opcode : Description
 
push : Pushes an element to the stack. 

pall : Prints all the values on the stack, starting from the to of the stack.

pint : Prints the value at the top of the stack.

pop : Removes the to element of the stack.

swap : Swaps the top to elements of the stack.

add  : Adds the top two elements of the stack. The result is then stored in the second node, and the first node is removed.

nop : This opcode does not do anything.
